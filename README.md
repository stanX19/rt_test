# rt_test

Project to test ray tracing using c++

## Intstallation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanX19/rt_test.git rt_test
cd rt_test
```

## Getting Started

1. Go to srcs/main.cpp to change some constants

2. Run by executing the following

	```
	make run
	```

3. After running, you can open the ppm image directly or use [this link](https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html) to view the image.

_the rendering might take awhile_
